# TRAFFIC-ANALYSIS
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing vehicle traffic data. The main objective is to study how the traffic situation varies across different times of the day, days of the week, and vehicle types (cars, bikes, buses, trucks). Through various data processing techniques, including preprocessing, outlier removal, and statistical analysis, the project provides insights into traffic patterns and busiest hours.

## Key Features:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Analysis of vehicle traffic based on different time intervals (hourly, weekly).
- Visualizations including boxplots, bar charts, heatmaps, and scatter plots.
- Detection and handling of outliers in vehicle count data.

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to understand traffic patterns, identify peak traffic hours, and provide visual insights that can be useful for urban planning and traffic management.

## Tools and Libraries:
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For generating visualizations like bar charts, boxplots, and VILIONS.

## Dataset:
This project uses a dataset containing information on vehicle counts (cars, bikes, buses, trucks) and traffic situation across different times and days.
